# What I learned (GitHub Basics)

- repo = project folder with history
- clone = copy from GitHub to my computer
- commit = local checkpoint with a message
- push = send commits to GitHub (the “server”)
- branch = safe place to work without touching main
- pull request = ask to merge branch; get feedback
- fork = copy someone else’s repo to my account
- issues = track tasks/bugs/ideas
- markdown = simple formatting in READMEs/issues/PRs

## What I did
- made branch `read-notes`
- added this file
- updated README with a progress section
